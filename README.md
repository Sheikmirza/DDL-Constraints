# DDL-Constraints
# Overview

This assignment focuses on Data Definition Language (DDL) constraints in MySQL. You will learn how to apply various constraints to ensure data integrity, enforce rules, and prevent invalid data entries in a database.
Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

Understand different types of constraints in MySQL.

Create tables with appropriate constraints.

Demonstrate the impact of constraints on database operations.
# Constraints Covered

The following DDL constraints will be explored:

PRIMARY KEY â€“ Ensures each record in a table is uniquely identified.

FOREIGN KEY â€“ Establishes relationships between tables.

NOT NULL â€“ Ensures that a column cannot store NULL values.

UNIQUE â€“ Ensures all values in a column are unique.

CHECK â€“ Enforces conditions on column values.

DEFAULT â€“ Assigns a default value if none is provided.

AUTO_INCREMENT â€“ Automatically generates unique values for primary keys.
# Conclusion:

This project demonstrates how DDL constraints enhance database reliability by enforcing data integrity at the structural level. By implementing these constraints, we can ensure that our MySQL database adheres to strict validation rules, preventing incorrect or inconsistent data entry.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
